Mobile Navigation and Tour App for Adler Planetarium.






This is an iphone application made for Chicago Adler Planetarium. The basic version gives turn-by-turn directions and wayfinding assistance from user's location to the desired destination. It displayes descriptional content for each exhibit and highlight ongoing special events.

This project is highly scaleable. A more ambition undertaking would include GPS location aware features, pre-loaded tours, the ability to build new tours and connectivity to facebook, twitter, etc. An advanced example of the type of application the Adler is looking for: http://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer
