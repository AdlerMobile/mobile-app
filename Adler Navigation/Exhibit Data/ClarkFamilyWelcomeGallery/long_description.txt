This futuristic, constantly changing environment features a one-of-a-kind architecture with vibrant lighting and video presentations. It was created using approximately 13,000 lineal feet of aluminum tubing and 20,000 square yards of fabric. The gallery also has 125 LED lights, each capable of producing sixteen million different colors and over two billion different lighting combinations.

This immersive environment allows you to explore space in different ways. You can engage with our interactives through movement and build exploration skills, thanks to the use of infrared sensors. Receive video greetings from some of todayâ€™s prominent space explorers, including NASA astronauts John Grunsfeld and Joan Higginbotham.
