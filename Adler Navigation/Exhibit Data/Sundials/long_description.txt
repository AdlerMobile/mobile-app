Saving Time: Collecting and Conserving Sundials highlights sundials from the Adlerâ€™s collection recently conserved as the product of a two-year preservation grant awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Focusing on themes of consumers, collecting, and conservation, the exhibit explores behind-the-scenes conservation activity and the story behind these sundials both before and after they reached the Adler.
