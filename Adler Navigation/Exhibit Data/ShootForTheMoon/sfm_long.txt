Shoot for the Moon shares the story of America's first journey into space in the 1960s as told through the powerful narrative of Jim Lovell. It includes the personal stories of Lovell's initial failures to gain acceptance into the U.S. Naval Academy and NASA astronaut program, and his ultimate success as a space pioneer. Visitors will gain insights about the moments leading up to his Gemini missions and learn how Lovell and others risked their lives to advance scientific understanding when human space flight was still in its infancy.

The exhibition continues the story from the Gemini program to focus on the historic accomplishments of the hugely successful Apollo missions, which saw America reach its goal of landing a man on the Moon.  The exhibition's Moon Wall lets visitors explore the surface of the Moon using the latest images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) currently orbiting the Moon.
