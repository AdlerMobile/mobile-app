Planet Explorers consists of three different play areas: Exploring Earth, which includes backyard stargazing, Exploring Space, which includes Mission Control, a rocket, and space station, and Exploring Planet X, which includes the Planet X Research Station. All of the play areas engage and entertain families with children ages 3 through 8.
Exploring Earth

Begin your adventure in a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired home and backyard where families can explore using MiScopes, electronic magnifying lenses that zoom in on the fine details of products and then display the details on TV monitors.
Exploring Space

Children can role play as members of the Mission Control ground team. Families can conduct planetary research together by operating rovers and space orbiters. They can also make preparations for space flight during the simulation of a rocket launch.

Future astronauts can climb aboard a two-story rocket and experience a simulated blast-off into outer space. They’ll check rocket systems, turn on the rocket's internal instruments and launch the rocket. First stop, the Space Station where families will find out that some tools work differently in space than they do on Earth.
Exploring Planet X

Young adventurers become planetary explorers and conduct research on the surface of another planet far, far away. They’ll explore caves and tunnels in search for evidence of water or life. Using X MOVERS, mini land-based vehicles, they’ll manuever and explore the Planet X terrain. Learn what life is like living in the Planet X Research Station.
